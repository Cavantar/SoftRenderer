** Tips
*** Don't get used to the old ways !!!.

I spend waay too much time couting variables instead of using debugger like civilized programmer that I am.

USE DEBUGGER !!!

I would have easily got 2 hours back. But on the other hand i might forget to use debugger next on something that's far more consuming.
