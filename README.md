# SoftRenderer

Build using SDL2 and Visual Studio 2015 Community. I promised myself that I'll be able to write basic 3d renderer with only being able to draw one pixel. This is the conclusion of this experiment. I was able to implement basic lighting and texture mapping (thanks to Chris Hecker articles).
